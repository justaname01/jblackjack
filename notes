Ok. So... basics:

1) game uses french deck (1-9, Ace, Face cards)
2) there's the dealer and the player(s)
3) game goes until 1 player exceeds 21, based on the value of their cards
4) 1-9 cards, regardless of suit, are worth their pip value (1-9, respectively)
5) Face cards are worth 10 points
6) It is up to each individual whether an ace is worth 1 or 11 points

From this, I have the card and deck as entities. Only question is whether I need to add the player as a unique entity

The card shall have a suit and a rank.
The deck shall be comprised of up to 52 cards.

In the interest of doing as little as possible in main, I'll make a separate player entity.

There shall be no less than 2 players in a game: one dealer and one player for each participant.
Each player shall possess an empty deck. The dealer shall possess the full deck and an empty deck for its own use.

deck shall be a subclass of ArrayList, and add the following functions:
clear() --- to clear the deck
draw() --- to draw a card
fill() --- to generate the default deck
shuffle() --- to shuffle the deck
sort() --- to sort the deck
